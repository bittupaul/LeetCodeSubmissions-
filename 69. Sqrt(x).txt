Question: 
Implement int sqrt(int x).
Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:
Input: 4
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        int sqrt = (int)Math.sqrt(x);
        return sqrt;
    }
}
