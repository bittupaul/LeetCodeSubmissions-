Question: 
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.
If the last word does not exist, return 0.
Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example:
Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        
        if(s.trim().length()==0)
            return 0;
        
        s = s.trim();
        String[] words = s.split("\\s+");
        return words[words.length-1].length();        
    }
}

/*
task: to find the length of the last word in a space separarted word-statement, if exists.

approach:
1. trim the string to remove leading and trailing space(s), if any.
2. split the statement by space delimiter and return the last word's length.

Time Complexity: linear O(n)
Space Complexity: linear O(n)
